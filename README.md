# Congratulations on Completing Phase 2! c

Congratulations on finishing Phase 2 of Flatiron School's Software Engineering
Program! In this phase, you built upon your understanding of JavaScript
programming by learning a popular frontend library: React.

You should now be able to:

- Create well-organized, easy-to-maintain code using React components
- Use props to pass data from parent components to child components
- Use events to capture user actions
- Use state and the `useState` hook to update the DOM in response to user actions
- Use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects such as fetching data from an API
- Use React Router to handle client-side routing

You now have all the skills you need to build dynamic single-page web
applications that interact with an API!
